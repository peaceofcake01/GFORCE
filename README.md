# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Giving Tree

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This website will give students an assesement as to where they stand on the giving spectrum and what
forms of giving they can work on to improve. This website will then allow each user to choose their track
on improving their own giving abilities and will provide tools to do so.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Users will need to log-in and create a personalized account that enters them into the database.
They have to take a diagonstic test to see what areas of giving they are strongest at and weakest at.
They will receive their unique score and can see which areas of giving they need to improve on.
There are 12 different areas of giving that will be noted and each of these will have their own distinct web-pages
with links to blogs, videos, and tips that can help improve that sort of giving. This mindfulness app would
be great as it also provides daily exercises that a person can journal and note and see improvement with.
There will also be a link for these miscellaneous challenges to be sent to the users inbox everyday, to
challenge them to work on their specific field of giving that they hope to improve. I believe that giving
and generosity is a key piece to happiness so being able to give people exercise to help give people a gratitude
for the world and to give back would be very rewarding.

## If planning to combine CS50's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to CS50, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I want to have at least 6 pages for the main forms of giving that are noted. Each page with an integrated interactive
blog and unique challenges and an email list that can work automatically and send people emails based on
their preferences

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

On top of what was mentioned above, I would like to have all 12 pages for the main forms of giving noted. I would also
like to build a reliable questionaire that can connect people to the areas of giving they most need help and additionally add a feature
for New Years Resolution.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

On top of what was mentioned previously, I would like to add a personalized touch, allowing people to connect with friends
and create unique avatars, this can allow people to connect as they try to better themselves. We can make this app readily availble to use by college students or different features for younger kids.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

How to create specific unique pages for individual users. Creating a specific survey and ensuring it's accuracy.
Integrating a blog into a website and how to give people permission to write in it.
How to target email lists and send out unique emails to different people.
Some additional python skills to make the website more adaptive for mobile use as well.
