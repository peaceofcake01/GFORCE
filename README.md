# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I would like to create a mindfulness IOS app based on Gratitude, with a couple different aspects, really there would be one main home
page with the gratitude task for a given day, then there will be another page with miscellaneous links
for mindfulness and then a last page for the benefits of mindfullness. The biggest thing within this
app that will be a challenge is ensuring that formatting and notifications work.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names, and who are their section leaders?

Unsure yet, probably going to work alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Is this project a bit too adventurous/ will there be support in building this app with people who
will be able to guide that process.
