#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have created a login and brainstormed content for the page along with creating the test that will be able to identify what areas of giving a person is strongest at!
I also have worked on the opening page and creating an account and sql table that shows a persons progress

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to work on implementing the challenges and to make a fun user-interface that will make them excited to work on giving
I also need to add a page for about us as to describe the mission and that content has not been written yet.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have run into a problem with sending emails to people to remind them of their daily tasks
I also wanted to learn how to allow people to edit and add their own content through the form of a journal on the website!
I wanted that to stay for the person for a longer period of time
